# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of World_Weather_Analysis
For this project, I was tasked by my company, PlayMyTrip, to create a Customer Travel Destinations Map and a Travel Itinerary Map.  These will allow customers to pick from cities around the world based on weater preferences.  Based on customer preference, a listing of hotels as well as an itinerary is provided to the customer to help them plan their ideal vacation.

* Weather Database - weather data was retrieved from 668 unique cities around the world to provide information including, but not limited to, maximum temperature, humidity levels,   wind speed and current weather description (cloudy, rain, sunny, etc.).

* Customer Travel Destinations Map - with this interative tool, consumers can input their preferred minimum and maximum temperature preferences to determine the best time of year to travel to specific destinations.  All options meeting their search criteria will pop up, with hotels for the city destinations.

* Travel Itinerary Map - map showing the route between four cities from the consumer's preferences.  An additional map is provided with pop-up markers for each city.

## World_Weather_Analysis Summary
The tools created for this project are extraordinarily useful for planning vacations, especially if a client would like to plan their vacation ahead of time.  Using this information, a client can select their weather preferences, hotels, and even get an itinerary for their trip.  They also have access to real-time information, such as current weather conditions, humidity level, and percent cloudiness.
