# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of World_Weather_Analysis
For this project, I was tasked by my company, PlayMyTrip, to create a Customer Travel Destinations Map and a Travel Itinerary Map.  These will allow customers to pick from cities around the world based on weater preferences.  Based on customer preference, a listing of hotels as well as an itinerary is provided to the customer to help them plan their ideal vacation.
