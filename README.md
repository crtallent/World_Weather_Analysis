# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of World_Weather_Analysis
For this project, I was tasked by my company, PlayMyTrip, to create a Customer Travel Destinations Map and a Travel Itinerary Map.  These will allow customers to pick from cities around the world based on weater preferences.  Based on customer preference, a listing of hotels as well as an itinerary is provided to the customer to help them plan their ideal vacation.

* Weather Database - weather data was retrieved from 668 unique cities around the world to provide information including, but not limited to, maximum temperature, humidity levels,   wind speed and current weather description (cloudy, rain, sunny, etc.).
